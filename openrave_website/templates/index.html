<p><b>{% trans "Latest Official Release:" %} {{RECENT_RELEASE}}</b></p>

<p>{% trans "OpenRAVE provides an environment for testing, developing, and deploying motion planning algorithms in real-world robotics applications. The main focus is on simulation and analysis of kinematic and geometric information related to motion planning. OpenRAVE's stand-alone nature allows is to be easily integrated into existing robotics systems." %}</p>
<p>{% trans "It provides many command line tools to work with robots and planners, and the run-time core is small enough to be used inside controllers and bigger frameworks. An important target application is industrial robotics automation." %}</p>
